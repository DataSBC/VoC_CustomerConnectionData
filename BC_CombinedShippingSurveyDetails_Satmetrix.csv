All 3 were supposedly “guaranteed” to be delivered within a certain number of days so they could be distributed to students before December break began. In addition to the paid student orders I had also placed orders for myself, and am disappointed that these books will not arrive in time for Christmas. While I understood that there could be potential delays in shipping, I received multiple notices from Scholastic over the last few weeks saying my order would arrive the next day or with incorrect delivery estimates. This is very unfortunate since I feel responsible for making sure the students received their orders on time, and they didn’t. While I have been a member of Scholastic Book Clubs for years, I had avoided it recently due to these shipping delays, and I thought things had been rectified. Obviously the post office is busy at this time of the year, but when people can order books on Amazon and get overnight delivery or visit a local bookstore and get books immediately I think it would be wise to give more accurate estimates for delivery in the future. For example, I could have told the families to submit their orders by an earlier date if I had known they wouldn’t arrive on time. Luckily I personally got many books for my own children in my November order since I was worried about shipping, but I hope my students and their families are not too disappointed and will continue to place orders in the future.",,I do not know if my orders are complete since I have still not received any of them.,No,No,No,Teacher Home Shipment,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1671828353249_13684

For whatever the reason, my package sat at a St. Louis shipping place for nearly 2 weeks.  By the time they got around to delivering it, our offices were closed for the Christmas holiday.  I ordered my package sometime around December 7.  For whatever reason, my package headed to Kansas City, arriving there December 8.  It finally traversed the state December 13th where it sat in a warehouse somewhere until an attempt at delivery was finally made December 22nd at 4 pm-- 4 hours after my school had closed for the Christmas holiday.  I tracked this package with it showing for 3 days that delivery would be made December 16, then December 19, then the 21, and finally the 22nd.  Now I assume my package will be heading back you as undeliverable despite the fact that this delivery fail is every bit on UPS and USPS.  I ordered before time to get it by Christmas but clearly not early enough for UPS to screw up delivery this badly by allowing a package to sit in a warehouse for 11 days.",,"Don't use UPS. They suck.  Delivery to a school after what would have been school hours from the beginning is ridiculous, but allowing a package to sit in a warehouse for 11 days is completely unacceptable.  I wish I knew if I would get my package.",No,No,Yes,Teacher School Shipment,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1671828341769_12826

I checked the times and it was during our school operating hours, so this obviously wasn’t true. So called Scholastic and was told by Scholastic employee to go to post office and see if I could pick it up. Excuse me? Then offered me 250 points. I refused both as this was totally inappropriate. So disappointed in Scholastic and their customer service.  You owe me and parents a refund ,which is what should have been offered. I’m dealing with an irate parent who needed the books by Christmas.

The delivery was frustrating and unsatisfactory. UPS mail innovations has caused delays in the delivery of our book boxes more than once, but this time it was extremely slow. Tracking information showed that our book box was in Denver (our town, same as delivery address) beginning Tuesday, Dec. 13, “pending acceptance.” On Thursday, Dec. 15, that had not changed, so I went to the post office to inquire about it. The clerk told me it wasn’t there, in spite of the tracking info to the contrary. He said as soon as they received it and checked it in, it would be out for delivery. On Friday the 16th, the tracking info showed it was out for delivery. On Saturday the 17th, I received an email saying it had been delivered. Monday the 19th, I checked with one of our administrators, and she said they had checked the mailbox earlier that morning but there was no mail. I went to the mailbox after that, and found our book box, along with other mail. I was very relieved to see it on Monday, since Tuesday the 20th was our last day of school, and I had two families waiting for books. UPS service is usually timely and reliable. When the post office is involved, the quality of service declines. I am disappointed about that, because I want the USPS to be timely and reliable, but they’re not. I recognize that there may be increased cost associated with using UPS to deliver all the way to the customer, and I understand the need to reduce costs. I just want you to be aware that reducing the financial cost of delivery also carries a reduction in the quality of service to your customers.",,"The tracking of my shipment, while convenient, was inaccurate.
